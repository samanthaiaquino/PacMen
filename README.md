# PacMen
This code animates PacMan images on a web page, allowing them to move left and right within the page boundaries. The direction and image of each PacMan change periodically. The checkPageBounds function ensures that all PacMen stay within the page. The code adds multiple PacMen to the webpage, creating a dynamic and interactive PacMan animation.
